git push rejected errors

A .the git push comman fails when the commits 
on your remote branch do not mach the commits on your local branch
B . the first solution you can try {and i dont recommended it}
is just using this command 
> git push origin master --force  in this case you would overwrite the remote branch
and destroy all files that you dont have in you lacal branch 

git pull -u origin master -- when you push a local branch with git push -u option
this local branch is linked with the remote branch automatically
